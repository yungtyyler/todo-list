# To-Do List
## By Tyler Varzeas

## Description:
In this project, I decided to create a web-based to-do list that allows the user to add action items to a list that is displayed below the form.
Each action item displays the text that was input by the user, a check mark button to display that the item has been completed, and a delete button to remove it from the list.
I have also added a dropdown select tool that allows the user to filter the list based on completed items and incomplete items, as well as reset it to show all items.
Another piece of functionality that has been implimented is the addition of saving the list to local storage. This allows the user to return to the webpage and pick back up where they had previously left off. When an item is deleted from the list, it is removed from the local storage as well and will not be shown again when the webpage is refreshed.

## Future plans:
I look to further improve this project by adding the option to customize the title of the page based on a prompt that the user will recieve when the webpage is opened. 

## Technology used:
JavaScript was the scripting language used for the backend of this project, and vanilla CSS was used for styling.
Google Fonts was used for custome font style.
Font-Awesome was also used for icon displays on buttons.
